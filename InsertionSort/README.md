<h2>üìç Insertion Sort Algorithm</h2>

<p>üîπ Insertion sort is a simple and intuitive sorting algorithm that works by building a sorted portion of the input list while iteratively inserting elements from the unsorted portion into their correct positions within the sorted portion. It is not the most efficient sorting algorithm for large lists but can be quite efficient for small lists or lists that are nearly sorted to begin with.</p>

<h3>üìù Here's how the insertion sort algorithm works:</h3>
<p>1- Start with an array or list of elements, with the first element considered as the sorted portion (since it's the only element).</p>
<p>2- Iterate through the unsorted portion of the list, starting from the second element (index 1) and moving towards the end of the list.</p>
<p>3- For each element in the unsorted portion, compare it with the elements in the sorted portion from right to left until you find the correct position for the element.</p>
<p>4- Shift the elements in the sorted portion to the right to make space for the current element, if necessary.</p>
<p>5- Insert the current element into the correct position in the sorted portion.</p>
<p>6- Repeat steps 3 to 5 until all elements are sorted.</p>
